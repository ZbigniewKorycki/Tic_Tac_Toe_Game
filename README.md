<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>

This Python script allows you to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a friend. Simply follow the prompts to enter the names of the players and make your moves. The script will display the game board, check for a winner, and provide an end result.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 84.
